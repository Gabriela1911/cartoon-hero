		<h2>About Barney</h2>
		<p>Barney Stinson (born 1976), is one of the five main characters in How I Met Your Mother, portrayed by Neil Patrick Harris. He first meets Ted Mosby in MacLaren's Pub in 2001 then initiates himself as part of the gang, fancying himself as Ted's best friend, despite Ted's protests.</p>
		<h2>Barney's characteristics</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Barney does not care what people think about his magic, his love of laser tag, his blog, or his love of suits; he loves those things and has no shame about it.</li>
			<li>It gets established time and time again that Barney is not only a talented liar but an incredibly compulsive liar, doing it consistently in just about every situation.</li>
			<li>Barney is a relentlessly determined individual.</li>
			<li>Barney has an extremely touchy family history, with an incredibly troubling upbringing aiding hugely in how messed up he is as an adult.</li>
			<li>Sticking with Barney and his family, growing up with his mother and brother, only made them pretty tight-knit, and one of Barney's most admirable features is his love for them.</li>
			<li>Barney's challenges got mentioned earlier and while they highlight his determination, they also are a significant part of how arrogant Barney can be.</li>
			<li>Barney may treat people he does not know pretty badly, and even his friends with basic insults, banter, and judgments, he is entirely loyal and devoted to his group of friends.</li>
			<li>Barney is very insulting towards his friends, as well as strangers, and pretty much all of these insults are judgments directed towards the various flaws he sees in them.</li>
			<li>Barney's insecurities have gotten talked about multiple times, and those insecurities have made Barney form a tough exterior, with a bro outlook on life, and a whole slew of issues.</li>
			<li>His skills at womanizing may be legen-wait for it-dary, but it is also disgusting. The pride he takes in it, the lengths he goes to, the potential selling of a woman, it is undoubtedly Barney's worst trait.</li>
		</ol>
